### :page_facing_up: About The Project

![Flick Finder Screenshot](assets/project-screenshot.png)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.
